## About Me

![Me](/img/about/me.jpg)

My name is Neal Dawson-Elli.  I am a Chemical Engineer, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer.
I love solving complex problems with machine learning, serving those solutions behind performant APIs,
explaining the solutions via data visualizations, and keeping the results up-to-date by incorporating a data engine.

I love tinkering, hiking, playing soccer, and traveling!
